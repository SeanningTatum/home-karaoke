# Harness invariant checker. Deterministic. No LLM. Exit non-zero on any violation.
#
# Two layers:
#   1. Brain-state invariants. If the brain-axi CLI (`brain`) is on PATH, run the authoritative
#        `brain check` (feature_list parses, ≤1 in-progress, feature doc paths, dependency refs,
#        progress.md exists, plan meta.json, reviews.jsonl, verification Verdict lines).
#        If not, fall back to the core invariants inline with jq — NO network dependency, so
#        offline dev still works (install brain-axi for the full check).
#   2. Repo-specific supplement (below) — invariants brain-axi does not own:
#        A. .brain/HARNESS.md exists
#        B. init.sh exists and is executable
#        C. CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md are the same file (symlink / byte-identical)
#        D. Every .claude/agents/*.md has YAML frontmatter with name + description
#        E. Core recipes (00-before-task, 99-verify-done) exist
#        F. Brain internal markdown links resolve
#        G. Every hook script referenced by .claude/settings.json exists and is executable
#        H. The rule-router path->rules mapping passes its own tests
#
# brain-axi is the primary harness interface; this script layers the repo-only checks on top.

  # STRICT IS A GATE, via a ratchet.

  # `--strict` additionally requires every shipped feature to carry a PASS
  # verification bound to a commit. Every feature here shipped before that
  # invariant existed and has no browser-walk evidence, so this started as an
  # advisory — but an advisory decays into noise, and review rightly called that
  # a dodge.
  #
  # The ratchet resolves it without fabricating anything: `policy.strict_grandfathered`
  # in feature_list.json lists exactly those legacy slugs, committed and
  # reviewable. Every NEW ship must satisfy the gate. The list only shrinks —
  # `brain check --strict` fails if an entry becomes fully provable and was left
  # on it. Close the debt by actually verifying those flows (`brain playbook
  # verify` -> feature-verifier browser walk -> `brain receipt <slug>`), then
  # delete the entry.
  #
  # CAPABILITY PROBE, not a version compare. `--strict` landed after v0.1.0, and
  # CI pins v0.1.0 (.github/workflows/ci.yml) — so this ran `brain check
  # --strict` against a CLI that rejects the flag, exited 2, and turned the
  # baseline job red on EVERY pull request. It passed locally only because a
  # developer `npm link`ed an unreleased checkout, which is the worst possible
  # split: green on the machine that wrote the code, red everywhere else.
