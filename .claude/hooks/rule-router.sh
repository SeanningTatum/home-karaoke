# PreToolUse(Edit|Write|NotebookEdit) hook: inject the .brain/rules layer doc that governs
# the file about to be edited. Deterministic path -> rule mapping. No LLM. Never blocks.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#   .brain/rules/ stays the single source of truth — it is tool-agnostic (Cursor, Codex and
#   Aider read it through the AGENTS.md pointer). Claude Code has no glob-scoped rules format
#   of its own, so this hook is the Claude-native *trigger* for those rules, not a second copy
#   of them. It emits pointers only; the agent reads the rule with `brain docs view`.
#
# The glob table below mirrors the "7 layer rules" table in .brain/rules/index.md.
# Keep the two in sync — scripts/test-rule-router.sh asserts the mapping.
#
# Each rule fires at most once per session (marker files under $TMPDIR) so a long editing
# session is not spammed with the same pointer on every Edit.

# jq is a hard requirement (harness-check.sh already depends on it). Without it, no-op rather
# than hand-parse the payload — tool_input contains arbitrary user code.
